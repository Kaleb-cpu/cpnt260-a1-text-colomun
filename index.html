  <h1>Climate change explained in a nutshell</h1>
  <div class="paragraphs">
  <p><div class="first">You have probably heard the words "climate change" more than once. That is because it is a very serious global condition, and if we, as a population don't take sincere action it might grow worse. Ok, but what is this serious global condition that we are talking about? In essence, Climate change is when the average weather patterns of a given region are changed for a long period of time. For instance, when wind patterns or the average temperature changes this causes climate change.</p></div></div>
  <h2><em>What causes Climate change?</em></h2>
  <div class="paragraphs">
  <p><div class="second">There is a historical background to climate change, it is believed that climate change grew exponentially after the industrial revolution in 1950. That is because there was way too much carbon dioxide intake. Ever since 1950, we have been burning more fossil fuels, which is one of the reasons that cause climate change. Even though carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses are present in the atmosphere, human activities amplified the natural greenhouse effect. As a result, the Earth's average temperature has increased by 0.75 degrees-Celcius. Human activities are not the only factor however, there are also natural processes that contribute to Climate change such as:</p></div></div>
